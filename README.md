# Snake Game Library

A flexible and extensible snake game library that can be easily integrated into various Python projects.

## Overview
Snake Game Library is a modern, event-driven implementation of the classic snake game, designed with extensibility and modularity in mind. It provides a robust foundation for building snake game variants and can be easily integrated into larger projects.

ðŸ¤– **AI-Powered Development**: This project is developed with the assistance of DeepSeek AI, leveraging advanced AI capabilities to ensure:
- Optimal code architecture
- Best programming practices
- Comprehensive documentation
- Intelligent game mechanics

## Features
